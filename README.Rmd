# Types of efficiency

--

.pull-left[

## Programmer efficiency

This is the amount of useful work a person (not a computer) can do per unit time

]

--

.pull-right[

## Computational efficiency

How quickly the computer can undertake a piece of work

]

--

One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation. (Ada Lovelace, [1842](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/introduction.html#ref-lovelace1842translator))

--

An efficient light shines bright with a minimum of energy consumption. In this final sense, efficiency has a formal definition as the ratio of work done per unit effort:

$$
\eta = \frac{W}{Q}
$$

# Efficient set-up

### Based on Efficient R programming [Chapter 2](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html)

## R and package versions  

.pull-left[

#### Keep your software up-to-date

```{r}
R.version

## Package selection

.pull-left[

- Is it mature?

- Is it actively developed? 

- Is it well documented? 

- Is it well used?

## Benchmarking your code

```{r, message=FALSE}
# 3 ways to read in files representing parks in Leeds
rds = function() readRDS("parks-west-yorkshire.Rds")
rgd = function() rgdal::readOGR(dsn = "parks-west-yorkshire.geojson", verbose = FALSE)
sfr = function() sf::read_sf("parks-west-yorkshire.geojson")
gsf = function() geojsonsf::geojson_sf("parks-west-yorkshire.geojson")

res = bench::mark(check = F, rds(), rgd(), sfr(), gsf(), time_unit = "ms")
res[1:5]
```

--

Which to use?

--

Package/data format choice -> 200 fold speed-up!

--

Rds fast + mem efficient, 'gsf' fast, memory hungry, sf slow but ubiquitous, rgdal ...

--

For reproducible code, see https://github.com/Robinlovelace/EfficientWorkflows

---

## Benchmark + check results

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, out.width="100%"}
plot(res)
```

---

## Always check your results

```{r}
# see https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html to learn  how to make more maps
mapview::mapview(gsf()) # the parks of West Yorkshire
```

---

## Other things R can do

.pull-left[

In addition to uneatable statistical capabilities

### R is also good at...

- Report/book/presentation making

- Image manipulation with the magick package - see [ropensci/magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick)

- Map making - see [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)

- Emailing (!) - see [rich-iannone/blastula](https://github.com/rich-iannone/blastula)

# Magic Touch: typing

![](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/figures/f1_1_800px-QWERTY-home-keys-position.png)

The evidence suggests that good diet, physical activity, plenty of sleep and a healthy work-life balance can all boost your speed and effectiveness at work (Jensen 2011; Pereira et al. 2015; Grant, Wallace, and Spurgeon 2013).

While we recommend the reader to reflect on this evidence and their own well-being, this is not a self help book. It is about programming. However, there is one non-programming skill that can have a huge impact on productivity: touch typing.
