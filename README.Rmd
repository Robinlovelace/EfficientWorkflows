# Types of efficiency

## Programmer efficiency

This is the amount of useful work a person (not a computer) can do per unit time

]

.pull-right[

## Computational efficiency

How quickly the computer can undertake a piece of work

One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation. (Ada Lovelace, [1842](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/introduction.html#ref-lovelace1842translator))

--

An efficient light shines bright with a minimum of energy consumption. In this final sense, efficiency has a formal definition as the ratio of work done per unit effort:

$$
\eta = \frac{W}{Q}
$$

# Magic Touch: typing

The evidence suggests that good diet, physical activity, plenty of sleep and a healthy work-life balance can all boost your speed and effectiveness at work (Jensen 2011; Pereira et al. 2015; Grant, Wallace, and Spurgeon 2013).

While we recommend the reader to reflect on this evidence and their own well-being, this is not a self help book. It is about programming. However, there is one non-programming skill that can have a huge impact on productivity: touch typing.
